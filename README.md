# What is this?
This project was created to fufill an assignment for my Game Labs I course at Quinnipiac University. After learning the properties and functionalities of working in a 3D environment, students were required to develop a 3D video game using Unity game engine.

# Bolerite
*Bolerite* is a 3D platformer, puzzle game. To keep a low profile, you have entered through the vents of a facility holding a valuable, and rare material. As a safe safety precaution, the owners of this facility lock the three different keys that open the room to this material. Sneak your way through the ventilation, jump and solve your way through locks, and retrieve the Bolerite.
